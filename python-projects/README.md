# Python Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a Python-based data analysis pipeline designed to extract, process, and visualize data from various sources. It includes web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover insights and trends in the data.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Extract data from websites using Python libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and data transformations using `pandas`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform statistical analysis and identify patterns in the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Create insightful plots and charts using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
