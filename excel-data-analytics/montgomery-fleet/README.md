# Montgomery Fleet Data Analysis

This project demonstrates data cleaning and analysis using Microsoft Excel on public fleet equipment inventory data provided by Montgomery County, Maryland.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two parts:

- **Part 1 – Data Cleaning**  
  Cleaned and prepared vehicle inventory data originally provided in CSV format. Tasks included formatting, removing duplicates and empty rows, correcting text issues, and restructuring department data for consistency.

- **Part 2 – Data Analysis with Pivot Tables**  
  Transformed the cleaned dataset into structured pivot tables to analyze fleet counts across departments and vehicle classes. Calculations were performed using AutoSum, and pivot tables were created to explore different hierarchical views of the data.

## Dataset

The dataset is a modified subset of the publicly available [Fleet Equipment Inventory](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Government/Fleet-Equipment-Inventory/93vc-wpdr) from Montgomery County, MD. All records are fictional or anonymized and used for demonstration purposes only.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning using Excel formulas, filters, and built-in tools
- Pivot table creation, sorting, and customization
- Dynamic summaries of department-level equipment counts
- Performed entirely in **Excel for the Web (Microsoft 365)**
