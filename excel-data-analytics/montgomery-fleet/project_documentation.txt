# Montgomery Fleet Equipment Inventory – Excel Data Cleaning & Analysis

## Overview
This project simulates the workflow of a Junior Data Analyst tasked with preparing and analyzing municipal fleet inventory data using Microsoft Excel for the Web. The dataset was provided in CSV format and required cleaning and preparation before meaningful analysis could be performed using pivot tables.

- **Tool:** Microsoft Excel for the Web (Microsoft 365)
- **Source:** [Montgomery County Open Data Portal](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Government/Fleet-Equipment-Inventory/93vc-wpdr)
- **Files Used:**
  - `rawdata_montgomery_fleet_equipment_inventory.csv` (Raw Data)
  - `cleaned_montgomery_fleet_equipment_inventory.xlsx` (Cleaned Data)
  - `part1_montgomery_fleet_equipment_inventory.xlsx` (Cleaned Input for Pivot Tables)
  - `part2_montgomery_fleet_equipment_inventory.xlsx` (Final Output with Pivot Tables)

## Part 1: Data Cleaning Process

### 1. File Format Conversion
- Opened the original `.csv` file in Excel for the Web.
- Converted it to `.xlsx` format using the built-in **Convert** option.

### 2. Adjust Column Widths
- Used **AutoFit** to ensure all data entries were visible without truncation.

### 3. Remove Empty Rows
- Applied filters to identify and delete any fully blank rows from the dataset.

### 4. Remove Duplicate Records
- Used **Conditional Formatting** to highlight duplicates.
- Removed duplicates using the **Remove Duplicates** feature, ensuring headers were preserved.

### 5. Spelling Corrections
- Ran Excel’s built-in spell checker.
- Manually reviewed and corrected entries, preserving abbreviations and department-specific terms.

### 6. Whitespace Cleanup
- Replaced all instances of double spaces with single spaces using **Find & Replace**.

### 7. Department Name Reconstruction
- Department names were incorrectly split across two adjacent columns.
- Used **Flash Fill** to merge the fragmented names into a single column.
- Deleted the redundant columns after validation.
- Verified department names against the official list provided.

## Part 2: Pivot Table Analysis

### 1. Format Dataset as a Table
- Applied **Format as Table** to enable structured referencing and improve pivot table interaction.

### 2. AutoSum Calculations on Equipment Count (Column C)
- Calculated the following statistics:
  - `SUM`: Total equipment count
  - `AVERAGE`: Mean equipment count per record
  - `MIN`: Minimum equipment count
  - `MAX`: Maximum equipment count
  - `COUNT`: Total number of records

### 3. Create and Configure Pivot Table 1 – Equipment by Department
- Placed **Department** in Rows.
- Placed **Equipment Count** in Values (summed).
- Sorted in descending order by equipment count.

### 4. Create Pivot Table 2 – Equipment Class under Department
- Duplicated Pivot Table 1 to a new worksheet.
- Added **Equipment Class** below **Department** in Rows.
- Collapsed all items except **Transportation** for focused view.

### 5. Create Pivot Table 3 – Department under Equipment Class
- Duplicated Pivot Table 1 to a third worksheet.
- Added **Equipment Class** above **Department** in Rows.
- Collapsed all items except **CUV** for focused view.
