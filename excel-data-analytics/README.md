# Excel Data Projects

This repository contains a collection of Excel-based data projects focused on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Microsoft Excel for the Web.

The projects demonstrate essential spreadsheet skills including:

- Data cleaning: handling duplicates, fixing formatting, correcting spelling, removing whitespace, and restructuring columns
- Exploratory data analysis using filters, formulas, and conditional formatting
- Pivot tables and summary views for aggregating and analyzing data
- AutoSum calculations and structured tables

Each project is documented with clear step-by-step instructions and includes both raw and cleaned datasets, along with final outputs.

All work was completed using Excel for the Web to ensure accessibility and reproducibility.
